# Blog Generation System

## Overview

The Blog Generation System is an agent-based system designed to generate high-quality blog content using a language model and supporting libraries such as LangChain. The system leverages tools like Wikipedia and search engines (e.g., DuckDuckGo) to conduct research on the given blog topic and produce a well-structured blog.

## Features
- Takes a blog topic as input and produces a well-structured blog as output.
- Utilizes a language model (e.g., GPT-3.5) to generate the blog content.
- Uses LangChain tools like Wikipedia and DuckDuckGo to gather information about the blog topic.
- The generated blog includes the following sections:
  - Heading: Clearly define the topic of the blog.
  - Introduction: Provide an engaging introduction to the topic.
  - Content: Present detailed and informative content, supported by research and relevant sources.
  - Summary: Summarize the main points covered in the blog.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- `langchain`
- `langchain_openai`
- `langchain_core`
- `langchain_community`
- `python-dotenv`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    cd blog-generation-system
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up API keys**:
    Create a .env file in the root of your project directory and add your API keys:
    ```properties
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the blog generation script**:
    ```sh
    python agent.py
    ```

2. **Input the blog topic**:
    To generate a blog on a specific topic, modify the `generate_blog` method call in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block of the agent.py file. Replace `"ChatGPT 4.5"` with your desired topic:

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        generator = BlogGenerator()
        blog = generator.generate_blog("Your Blog Topic Here")
        print("\nGenerated Blog:\n")
        print(blog)
    ```

## Code Structure
- agent.py: Contains the `BlogGenerator` class which initializes the language model, tools, and agent, and provides a method to generate a blog.
- .env: Contains the API keys for Google and OpenAI.

## Challenges Encountered
- This was my first project and making it public using LangChain.
- Properly setting up and loading API keys from the .env file.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- Add more tools for research, such as additional search engines or specialized knowledge bases.
- Implement error handling and logging for better debugging and monitoring.
- Optimize the prompt and model parameters for better blog generation quality.
- UI making and API for website output

## Example Output
Here is an example of a generated blog on the topic "ChatGPT 4.5":
